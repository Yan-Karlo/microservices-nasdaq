### Seeding Process
You are expected to populate the tables through the seeding process:
~~~~
http://localhost:3001/v1/seeding
~~~~
The seeding files are located in the following folder: `api-service\config\seeding-data`
ðŸ§¨ Whenever this process is trigged all documents are deleted in the collections.ðŸ§¨


### Making the login
You must make a login to receive the token to be used on the tests:
~~~~
http://localhost:3001/v1/users/login
~~~~

For that you can use the json below in the body :
~~~~
{
	"email" : "admin@admin.com",
	"password" : "admin"
}
~~~~

You can do any modification as you wish in the user seeding file.
